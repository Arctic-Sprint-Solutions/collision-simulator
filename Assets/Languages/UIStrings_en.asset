    m_Localized: "Orbital Watch is a visual tool created to simulate simple collisions
      between satellites and space debris. Developed using the Unity game engine
      and Blender for 3D modeling, Orbital Watch provides a visual representation
      of collisions in space. Satellite models have been imported from NASAs publicly
      available 3D model library.\n\n\uFFFD Show students the growing challenge of
      space debris \n\uFFFD Observe collisions from different angles and how they
      affect various satellites  \n\uFFFD Learn how space debris is a growing concern

    m_Localized: New technology and the commercialization of satellite systems have
      led to an increasing number of satellites being launched into space. When objects
      break apart or collide in orbit, they create what is known as space debris.
      More research is needed to understand the effects space debris has on satellites,
      but raising awareness is where it begins.

    m_Localized: "During the spring of 2025 a project was added to the Bachelor of
      Computer Science at UiT The Arctic University of Norway called \uFFFDVisualization
      of collisions between satellites and space debris\uFFFD. The project\uFFFDs
      main requirements were to create a visual tool which could simulate simple
      collisions between satellites and space debris. The tool was to be used during
      teaching so that more students (and other potential stakeholders) can learn
      more about the effects of space debris. \n \nThe client requesting the project
      was P\uFFFDl Gunnar Ellingsen, an Associate professor within satelite technology
      and remote sensing at the Department of Electrical Engineering at UiT. The
      head advisor the project was Frode Nesje, Assistant Professor at the Department
      of Computer Science and Computational Engineering at UiT.\n\nThe project was
      taken on by the dev team of Arctic Sprint Solutions 2.0, consisting of four
      graduating students in the field of Bachelor of Computer Science (Datateknikk)
      at UiT: Madeleine Woodbury, Ola Gi\uFFFDver, Gabriel Halstensen and Ingrid
      Ledingham. \n\n\n"

    m_Localized: 'The main challenge of simulating collisons between space debris
      is the lack of research on how collisions make objects behave in space. Objects
      moving through orbit typically travel at extremely high speeds - as much as
      7 kilometers per second (25 000 kilomters/hour). Comparatively a rifle bullet
      moves at the speed of 1.2 kilomters/second, a mere fraction of this. When two
      objects collide in orbit at such velocities, the realtive collision speed might
      reach as much as 15 kilomters/second (54 000 kilometers/hour). Simulating such
      high speed collisions can therefore be difficult. Both when simulating objects
      through physical experiments, as well as when visualizing collisions with tools
      such as Orbit Watch. It is hard to mimic collision effects that there is little
      to no real-world data available.

      to provide accurate representations of how objects physically behave in orbit
      when colliding. \n\n"

    m_Localized: "Although Orbital Watch was created to simulate simple collisions,
      it holds potential for further development \uFFFD possibly as part of a Master
      of Applied Science assignment. Future improvements could include more research
      into real space physics, enabling more accurate depictions of collisions in
      orbit. One might also consider experimenting with more advanced game engines,
      such as Unreal, to enhance the graphical quality and allow for greater customization.\n\nFurther
      development would likely require additional time and resources to reach a higher
      level of simulation fidelity. But much like in the world of video games, there\uFFFDs
      always room for a sequel \uFFFD one with higher resolution and even more content.\n"
