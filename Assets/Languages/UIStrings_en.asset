    m_Localized: New technology and the commercialization of satellite systems have
      led to an increasing number of satellites being launched into space. When objects
      break apart or collide in orbit, they create what is known as space debris.
      More research is needed to understand the effects space debris has on satellites,
      but raising awareness is where it begins.

    m_Localized: "During the spring of 2025 a project was added to the Bachelor of
      Computer Science at UiT The Arctic University of Norway called \"Visualization
      of collisions between satellites and space debris.\" The projects main requirements
      were to create a visual tool which could simulate simple collisions between
      satellites and space debris. The tool was to be used during teaching so that
      more students (and other potential stakeholders) can learn more about the effects
      of space debris. \n \nThe client requesting the project was P\xE5l Gunnar Ellingsen,
      an Associate professor within satelite technology and remote sensing at the
      Department of Electrical Engineering at UiT. The head advisor the project was
      Frode Nesje, Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and
      Computational Engineering at UiT.\n\nThe project was taken on by the dev team
      of Arctic Sprint Solutions 2.0, consisting of four graduating students in the
      field of Bachelor of Computer Science (Datateknikk) at UiT: Madeleine Woodbury,
      Ola Gi\xE6ver, Gabriel Halstensen and Ingrid Ledingham. "

    m_Localized: 'The main challenge of simulating collisons between space debris
      is the lack of research on how collisions make objects behave in space. Objects
      moving through orbit typically travel at extremely high speeds - as much as
      7 kilometers per second (25 000 kilomters/hour). Comparatively a rifle bullet
      moves at the speed of 1.2 kilomters/second, a mere fraction of this. When two
      objects collide in orbit at such velocities, the realtive collision speed might
      reach as much as 15 kilomters/second (54 000 kilometers/hour). Simulating such
      high speed collisions can therefore be difficult. Both when simulating objects
      through physical experiments, as well as when visualizing collisions with tools
      such as Orbit Watch. It is hard to mimic collision effects that there is little
      to no real-world data available.

    m_Localized: 'In order to create a visual tool for space debris collisions, it
      has been important to set aside attempts to capture how objects actually behave
      in space. The project has been commissioned to simulate simple collisions,
      not to provide accurate representations of how objects physically behave in
      orbit when colliding. '

    m_Localized: 'Although Orbital Watch was created to simulate simple collisions,
      it holds potential for further development possibly as part of a Master of
      Applied Science assignment. Future improvements could include more research
      into real space physics, enabling more accurate depictions of collisions in
      orbit. One might also consider experimenting with more advanced game engines,
      such as Unreal, to enhance the graphical quality and allow for greater customization.


      Further
      development would likely require additional time and resources to reach a higher
      level of simulation fidelity. But much like in the world of video games, there
      is always room for a sequel; one with higher resolution and even more content.'
